    <p> <div class="intro">
       <p>My name is Faith Iminza as stated above.I'm currently learning at Moringa School in Kenya,located along Ngong road.I had to defer from the course i was doing in the university.I was called in KCA(Kenya School of Accountancy)to pursue a course called Bachelor of Business and Information Technology(BBIT).Now I wish to fully devote myself to a Front-End Developer job.
      My main professional goal is to find a job that will give me an opportunity to deepen and improve previously acquired programming skills, engage in interesting and creative projects and raise my Front-End development qualifications.</p>
      <p>So far I've worked with technologies such as <span class="important">HTML</span>,<span class="important">CSS</span> and <span class="important">Github</span> on a daily basis.</p>
